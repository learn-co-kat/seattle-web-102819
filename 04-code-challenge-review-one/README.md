# Object Relations Practice: Event Edition

Three models in this case :
- Event    :
- Attendee :
- Location :

## Notes

Your goal is to build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables.

We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb` from the command line. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here. Take a look at that file to see how you can pre-define variables and create object instances, rather than manually doing it in every single console session.

**Remember!** This is a code challenge without tests. You cannot run `rspec` you cannot run `learn`. You'll need to create your own sample instances for testing purposes. Make sure your associations and methods work in the console before submitting.
