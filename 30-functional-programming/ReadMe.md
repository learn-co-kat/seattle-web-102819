## Functional Programming 

## Goals
-  Understand functional programing principles
-  Functions as first class Objects
-  Functions as objects 
    - [x] Assigning functions to variables 
    - [x] Pass functions as arguments to other functions
    - [x] Return functions inside of functions
    - [x] functions on functions inside of functions 
    - [x] Scope

-  Pure functions 
   - Return a value
   - Have no side effects
   - given the same input will have the same output

- Avoiding Shared State
- Mutable Data
    -  Object.freeze
- Side Effects
